# Password-Generator
## A useful application for obtaining a new and secure password!

This application utilizes a variety of methods in order to successfully generate a keyword for the end user. While working on this project, I implemented arrats, if statements, for loops, alerts, and event listeners in order to ultimately create a functional application that is simple and easy for anyone to use for a practical solution to an often recurring requirement to for data privacy and logins.
